### Configure Authentication Methods

#### General
* Keep me signed in (KMSI) sets a session cookies good for 180 days to preserve a user's login session

#### Azure AD Password Hash Sync
* Users use same username and password as on-premises
* Required by Identity Protection and Azure AD Domain Services
* Password hashes are hashed and synced to Azure AD every two minutes (sync frequency cannot be changed)
* Keep me signed in (KMSI) sets a session
* Password complexity and expiration of on-premises is honored (use case for custom password filters)
* Can be used as failover method for Passthrough Authentication and Federated Authentication but requires manual changes
* Can't limit which users in scope of a sync have passwords synced; all synced users or none
* Account that expires on-premises (accountExpires attribute) is not honored in Azure AD and the Azure AD account must be manually disabled.
* Service account used by Azure AD Connect must have Replicate Directory Changes and Replicate Directory Changes All in Windows Server Active Directory
* Express Settings of Azure AD Connect automatically configure PHS

#### Azure AD Passthrough Authentication
* Passwords do not have to be synced to Azure AD
* On-premises password policies are honored
* Lightweight agent runs on-premises on domain controllers and communicates with a proxy service running on a member server which communicates with Azure AD
* Supports on-premises UPN and Alternate Id
* Available for all SKUs of Azure AD
* Supports Azure MFA, Conditional Access Policies (limited), Self-Service Password Reset using Password Writeback
* Only Global Administrators can add PTA agents
* Use cases are when you do not want to synchronize passwords, you want to enforce on-premises security and password policies, or you want to use an Alternate ID
* Not integrated with Azure AD Connect Health so no PTA agent reporting available
* Conditional Access Policies supported include Azure MFA, Blocking Legacy authentication, and filtering brute force attacks
* Certificate Authority that signs the certificates issued to the PTA agents lives in Microsoft's cloud and is only used for this purpose

#### Azure AD Smart Lockout
* Protects against brute force attacks
* Intelligence to detect normal user behavior from an attackers
* Blocks sign-in attempts for one minute after 10 failed logins
* Capable of tracking last three password hashes used to avoid incrementing the counter when the same password is used multiple times (typical user behavior) (not available for PTA)
* Enabled by default for all Azure AD SKUs but can be customized with Basic+
* Supported for PHS and PTA
* Azure AD Admin user cannot unlock an Azure AD account locked by Smart Lockout
* When PTA is used set the AAD lockout threshold less than the on-premises AD so the account locks out in AAD and doesn't impact on-premises AD
* When PTA is used set the AAD lockout threshold counter so that on-premises does not become locked out by bad attempts in Azure AD

#### Azure AD Password Protection
* Prevents users from using commonly guessed password
* Available for both Azure AD and Windows Server AD
* Provided to all Azure AD SKUs for the global list maintained by Microsoft for Cloud Users only
* Azure AD Premium P1 or above is required to use this feature for synchronized users
* Azure AD Premium P1 or above is required to create a custom banned password list
* The custom banned password list can be enforced or audited
* Extending the service to Windows Server AD requires an agent be installed on the domain contorllers and a proxy service be installed on a member server
* Enforced during change password or reset password in Azure AD

#### Seamless Single Sign-On
* Users automatically signed in to supported applications that are integrated with Azure AD when using their corporate desktops
* Available for PTA and PHS
* User's device must be domain-joined
* Available for all Azure AD SKUs
* Provisions a service account in each Active Directory forest being sychronized to the Azure AD tenant and synchronizes the Kerberos key to Azure AD so it can decrypt Kerberos tickets sent by domain-joined devices
* Enabled via Azure AD Connect

### Install and Configure Azure AD Connect
#### Azure AD Connect Health
* monitors health of Azure AD Connect Sync, AD FS, or AD DS by providing alerts, performance monitoring, and usage analytics
* Requires Azure AD Premium P1+
