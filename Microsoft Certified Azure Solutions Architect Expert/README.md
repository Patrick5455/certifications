# README
Hello there!  Included in studyguide.md is a study guide I used to pass the certification.  The first line of the document notes the last date I updated the document.  It comes with no warranty and use it as your own risk.  I highly recommend you use it as a template to create your own updated template.

Feel free to submit corrections or additions and I'd be happy to approve!
